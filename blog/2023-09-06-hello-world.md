**Hello World**

As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) defines it:

_A "Hello, World!" program is generally a computer program that ignores any input, and outputs or displays a message similar to "Hello, World!". A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. "Hello, World!" programs are often the first a student learns to write in a given language,[1] and they can also be used as a sanity check to ensure computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it._

This is the "Hello World" of our technology blog. The goal of this blog is to share what's going on with technology at IgorBox.
